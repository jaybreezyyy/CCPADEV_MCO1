              I was really excited to try Dixie's after hearing good things about it, but sadly, my experience was disappointing. The service was slow, and it took longer than expected for our orders to arrive, even though the place wasn't that busy. When the food finally came, it was lukewarm instead of hot, which made the experience less enjoyable.

              I ordered the Sizzling Chicken Steak, but it didn’t live up to the hype. The meat was tough and lacked flavor. The sizzling plate also wasn’t hot enough to give the sizzling experience I was expecting. I also tried their Tapsilog, but the tapa was too salty, and the rice was undercooked, which was disappointing.

              On top of that, the ambiance was a bit uncomfortable—the place felt cramped, and the tables were too close together. It didn’t feel very cozy or inviting.

              Overall, I was expecting more based on the reviews, but unfortunately, my visit to Dixie's Taft didn’t meet the mark. I’m not sure if I’ll be coming back anytime soon.
