              If you're ever around De La Salle University, make sure to swing by Zark's Burgers – it’s the perfect spot to satisfy your burger cravings! Located just across from DLSU, it's incredibly convenient for students, and the food is next-level.

I went for their signature Tombstone Burger, and wow, this beast of a burger definitely lives up to the hype. Eight juicy patties, layers of melted cheese, and that special cheese sauce—each bite was indulgent and so filling! The portion size is huge, and it’s honestly a challenge to finish, but it’s totally worth it for anyone who loves a massive burger.

The Thunder Mac N' Cheese is another favorite of mine. A juicy burger patty topped with creamy mac and cheese—what a genius combo. It’s the kind of burger that you can’t stop thinking about after you’ve had it. For anyone who loves cheese, I highly recommend The Three Pointer burger, which is packed with three different kinds of cheese. Cheesy goodness in every bite.

The place itself has a casual, no-fuss vibe that’s perfect for hanging out with friends or grabbing a quick bite. Plus, the service is always friendly, and the food arrives fast—great for students on a time crunch between classes.

Overall, if you're in the Taft area, Zark's Burgers is a must-visit. They have everything: tasty burgers, massive portions, and a chill atmosphere. Whether you're there to tackle the Tombstone or enjoy a classic burger, you're guaranteed a satisfying meal every time.
