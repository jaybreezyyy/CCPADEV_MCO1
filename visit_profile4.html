              If you‚Äôre ever in the Taft area, especially near DLSU, you‚Äôve got to try Tagpuan Berde‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite go-to spots for comfort food. I‚Äôve been here multiple times, and every time, it delivers. The Bulalo is a must-try! The broth is rich, flavorful, and packed with that slow-cooked goodness. The meat just falls off the bone, and the bone marrow? Chef‚Äôs kiss. If you‚Äôre craving something hearty, it‚Äôs perfect for you. I also love their Ginataang Tilapia‚Äîthe fish is perfectly cooked, and the coconut milk sauce is so creamy and comforting. It‚Äôs one of those dishes that warms you right up. For something lighter, their Chop Suey is another winner, with a great balance of vegetables and meat that‚Äôs stir-fried just right. The prices are super reasonable, and considering the portion sizes, it‚Äôs such a good value for money. The place itself is cozy and chill, with a casual vibe perfect for hanging out with friends or grabbing a quick lunch between classes. Service is always friendly, and the food arrives quickly, which is great when you‚Äôre in a rush. Definitely recommend Tagpuan Berde for anyone in the area looking for delicious Filipino comfort food that doesn‚Äôt break the bank. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!
